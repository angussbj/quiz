# Anatomy 3D Renderer

React Three Fiber renderer for 3D skeleton quizzes. Renders a GLB model with per-bone coloring driven by element visual states.

## Architecture

The renderer has three nested component layers inside a single `<Canvas>`:

1. **`SkeletonMeshes`** — loads the GLB, clones it for bilateral mirroring, deep-clones materials for independent coloring, computes bone centers and camera views, handles pointer events.
2. **`Scene`** — orchestrates lights, OrbitControls, camera animation, and the label overlay.
3. **`Anatomy3DRenderer`** (exported) — the top-level component matching `VisualizationRendererProps`. Manages sidebar UI and local state (label mode, camera views).

## GLB Model and Bilateral Mirroring

The GLB (`public/data/bones-3d/overview-skeleton.glb`) contains only right-side (`.r` suffix) and midline bones. Left-side bones are rendered by cloning the entire scene and scaling it by `(-1, 1, 1)` on the x-axis. This means:

- Right-side bones: rendered in the original scene.
- Left-side bones: rendered in the mirrored scene (same mesh, flipped).
- Midline bones: rendered only in the original scene (the mirrored copy overlaps at x=0 and is skipped during coloring).
- **Exception**: `Parietal bone left` and `Parietal bone right` are both directly in the GLB (not mirrored).

The `meshMap` keys encode this: `"original:MeshKey"` or `"mirrored:MeshKey"`.

## Three.js Name Sanitization

Three.js GLTFLoader sanitizes node names: **spaces become underscores**, dots are stripped. The `toNodeKey()` function applies the same transform so lookups match. Any hardcoded mesh name references (e.g. camera preset bone lists) must use original GLB names — `toNodeKey` handles the comparison.

## Sidebar Controls

The sidebar is rendered outside the R3F `<Canvas>` as regular HTML. It contains:

- **Camera presets** — 7 buttons (Full body, Skull, Torso, Legs, Hand, Foot, Back) with keyboard shortcuts. Each computes a `CameraView` (position + target) from bone bounding boxes at model load time.
- **Label mode** — Off / Hover / On segmented control, managed as local component state (not a quiz toggle).

## Label Visibility

Labels are sprite-based (canvas-rendered text textures that always face the camera). Visibility is governed by both the element's visual state and the label mode setting:

| Element State | Off | Hover | On |
|---|---|---|---|
| `default` / `highlighted` / `hidden` | — | — | — |
| `correct` / `correct-*` / `incorrect` / `missed` / `context` | — | Hovered only | Yes |

Key design decision: labels **never** appear for unanswered bones (`default`, `highlighted`), regardless of label mode. This prevents the label control from revealing answers. The mode only controls noise among already-answered labels.

Bilateral bones get two label sprites (one per side, mirrored on x). Label scale varies by body zone (`zoneScale`) — extremities (hands, feet, head) use smaller labels to avoid clutter.

## Element State Colors

Each visual state maps to a `{mesh, emissive, opacity}` triple applied to `MeshStandardMaterial`:

| State | Mesh Color | Emissive | Opacity |
|---|---|---|---|
| `default` | `--color-bone-default` (#e4ccb1) | black | 1.0 |
| `hidden` | grey | black | 0.0 |
| `highlighted` | `--color-highlighted` | #443300 | 1.0 |
| `context` | `--color-bone-context` | black | 0.55 |
| `correct` | `--color-correct` | #003311 | 1.0 |
| `correct-second` | `--color-correct-second` | #002200 | 1.0 |
| `correct-third` | `--color-correct-third` | #001100 | 1.0 |
| `incorrect` | `--color-incorrect` | #330000 | 1.0 |
| `missed` | `--color-missed` | #221100 | 1.0 |

Meshes not in the quiz element list (e.g. teeth when `showTeeth` is off) use a hardcoded context style: `#c8bba8` at 50% opacity.

The default bone color (#e4ccb1) matches the GLB asset's original material base color.

## Drag Detection

OrbitControls and bone click handlers coexist. A pointer-down/move ref tracks drag distance; clicks are suppressed when the pointer moved >5px (same threshold as the 2D map renderer). This prevents camera orbiting from registering as a locate answer.

## Camera Animation

`CameraAnimator` uses `useFrame` to lerp camera position and OrbitControls target toward the preset view. Convergence threshold is 0.5mm. The `onDone` callback clears the animation target so the lerp stops.
